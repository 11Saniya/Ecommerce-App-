### Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/11Saniya/Ecommerce-App-

###### Set Up Backend (Spring Boot Project)
Clone the Backend Repository:

Clone the backend repository for Ecommerce website. Make sure you have Git installed on your machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/11Saniya/Ecommerce-App-/tree/main/src

Import Project into IDE:

Open your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse. Import the Spring Boot project as an existing Maven project.

Configure Database Connection:

Open the application.properties (or application.yml if you use YAML configuration) file in your project's resources folder. Configure the database connection properties according to your database setup. For example:

### properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
spring.datasource.username=your_database_username
spring.datasource.password=your_database_password
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
Database Setup:

Create the required database for your e-commerce website in your MySQL (or other supported) database server. You can use the database management tool of your choice to create the database schema.

Run the Backend Application:

Build the Spring Boot application and run it using your IDE's run configuration or use the following command in the terminal:

arduino
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
This will start the backend server at the default port (usually 8080).

###### Set Up Frontend
Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I don't have access to your specific project's frontend code and structure, so I can't provide specific instructions for setting up the frontend. However, below are some general steps you can follow:

Clone the Frontend Repository:

Clone the frontend repository for your e-commerce website. Make sure you have Git installed on your machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/11Saniya/Ecommerce-App-/tree/main/src/main/resources
Install Node.js and npm:

Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download them from the official Node.js website.

### Install Dependencies: 
##### Thymeleaf Dependency
Thymeleaf is a powerful and feature-rich template engine for Java-based web applications. It allows us to create dynamic and data-driven web pages by seamlessly integrating with HTML. In our project, we have leveraged Thymeleaf to efficiently render dynamic content and handle server-side data processing.

To use Thymeleaf in this Spring Boot project, we have added the Thymeleaf dependency to the project's build configuration. This enables automatic configuration of Thymeleaf within the Spring Boot application, allowing us to use Thymeleaf's expressive syntax and features in our HTML templates.

The dependency is specified in the   pom.xml    file for Maven-based projects or build.gradle for Gradle-based projects. Spring Boot's auto-configuration ensures that Thymeleaf is readily available for use, and we can start creating dynamic templates with ease.

Thymeleaf has greatly simplified the process of building dynamic web pages, enabling us to focus on delivering a seamless user experience by rendering data dynamically on the client-side while maintaining clean and readable HTML templates on the server-side.



Navigate to the frontend project directory and install the required dependencies using npm.

bash
Copy code
cd your-frontend-repo
npm install
Configure Backend Endpoint:

In your frontend code, configure the API endpoint to communicate with the backend server. For example, if your backend is running on localhost:8080, set the endpoint accordingly in your frontend code.

Run the Frontend Application:

Start the frontend application using the npm script specified in your project's package.json file.

sql
Copy code
npm start
This will launch the frontend application, and you can access it in your web browser at the specified URL (usually http://localhost:3000).

Explore the E-Commerce Website
With both the backend and frontend running, you can now explore your e-commerce website by visiting the frontend URL in your web browser. Test the various features, such as product browsing, searching, adding items to the cart, and the checkout process.

Remember, these instructions are general guidelines, and you may need to adapt them based on your specific project's structure and technologies used.
